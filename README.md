### If you already installed in Claude Desktop

Enable `chat.mcp.discovery.enabled: true` in your settings and VS Code will discover existing MCP server lists, and proceed to [use the tool in GitHub Copilot Agent mode](#using-tools-in-copilot).

### If you did not install in Claude Desktop

If you want to associate the MCP server with a specific repo, create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file with this content:

   ```json
   {
     "inputs": [],
     "servers": {
        "marvel-api": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": [
                "/PATH/TO/marvel-mcp-server/dist/index.js"
            ],
            "env": {
                "MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY": "",
                "MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY": "",
                "MARVEL_API_BASE": "https://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public"
            }
        }
     }
   }
   ```

If you want to associate the MCP server with all repos, add to your VS Code User Settings JSON:

   ```json
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
        "marvel-api": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": [
                "/PATH/TO/marvel-mcp-server/dist/index.js"
            ],
            "env": {
                "MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY": "",
                "MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY": "",
                "MARVEL_API_BASE": "https://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public"
            }
        },
    }
  },
  "chat.mcp.discovery.enabled": true,
   ```

## Using tools in Copilot

1. Now that the mcp server is discoverable, open GitHub Copilot and select the `Agent` mode (not `Chat` or `Edits`).
2. Select the "refresh" button in the Copilot chat text field to refresh the server list.
3. Select the "üõ†Ô∏è" button to see all the possible tools, including the ones from this repo.
4. Put a question in the chat that would naturally invoke one of the tools, for example: 

    ```
    Get a list of Marvel characters and output as a bulleted list.

    What comics is Wolverine in?
    
    Which characters appear in the Avengers comics?
    ```
